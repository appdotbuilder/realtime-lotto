    // 2. Load all players for the game
    // 3. Compare each player's selected_numbers with drawn_numbers
    // 4. Find exact matches (all 5 numbers match in any order)
    // 5. Update is_winner flag for winning players
    // 6. Update game status to 'completed' and set completed_at timestamp
    // 7. Emit real-time event announcing winners
    // 8. Return array of winning players
