    // 1. Find the player by ID and validate they belong to the specified game
    // 2. Validate the game is still in 'waiting' status (can't leave during play)
    // 3. Remove the player record from the database
    // 4. Decrement the game's current_players count
    // 5. Emit real-time event to notify other players
    // 6. If game has no players left, optionally clean up the game
    // 7. Return success status
